{- We now introduce a type to represent the natural numbers using
Peano arithmetic.

In this arithmetic, there are two especially important rules
- zero is a natural number
- the successor of any natural number is a natural number

From this pair of rules arises an infinity of natural numbers. Zero is
a natural number, and the successor of any natural number is a natural
number, so the successor of zero is a natural number; and now, because
the successor of zero is a natural number, its successor, i.e., the
successor of (the successor of zero) is one too; ad infinitum!

HOMEWORK #1: Learn this way of thinking by rehearsing it mentally
until you've really got it. Work with friends. Explain it to each
other. Test each other. -}

{- We capture this idea with the following deceptively simple data
type definition. What it says is that nat is a type, and there are two
ways to construct a nat. One is to use the constructor, O. The other
is to apply the constructor S to a value that is already known to be
of type nat.  Because O is already known to be of type nat, you can
thus apply S to O (yielding the term (S O)) and the result is also of
type nat. And now because it is a value of type nat, you can apply S
to it to get another value of type nat. Ad infinitum.

HOMEWORK #2: Study and think about this example as many times as
necessary to get it. Work with friends. Teach each other. Test each
other.  -}

-- Here's our data type definition.

||| A data type to represent the natural numbers.  We use a lower case
||| "n" in the name to distinguish our nat type from Idris's Nat type
data nat = O | S nat

-- HOMEWORK #3: In the REPL ask what are the types of nat, O and S.
-- Be sure you understand the answers! Teach, learning from and test
-- friends.

{-
Here are some examples of some objects (named values) of type nat.
-}


-- HOMEWORK #6: In the REPL, evaluate the types and values of rez, o, t
-- and r, as well as your own values. (E.g., ":t o" will report the
-- type of o, and "o" will report its value (along with its type). Be
-- sure you understand the answers. In particular be sure you
-- understand how the variable expression, "r" is evaluated! Yup: r is
-- unfolded to S t; t is unfolded to S (S O); so the whole expression
-- unfolds to S (S (S O)). Be able to explain this evaluation process
-- verbally and in writing. Teach and test each other.

pred: nat -> nat
pred O = O
pred (S n) = n

{- Next we define a function that when given a natural number returns
true if it's even and false otherwise. It is very, very important to
understand this example, your first example of a recursive function -}

||| return true if the argument is even otherwise false
evenb: nat -> bool
evenb O = true
evenb (S O) = false
evenb (S (S n)) = evenb n

||| return false if the argument is even othrewise true

oddb: nat -> bool
oddb n = not (evenb n)

-- HOMEWORK #9 Bind a, b, c, d, e respectively to the results applying evenb to O, (S O), (S (S O)) r, and (S r),
-- respectively. Add your code here.
--HOMEWORK #10 In English, describe all of the steps involved in
--evaluating the function application expression, evenb (S r). You
--must be able to explain this process to yourself and your friends!
--The idea is that you keep on applying reduction (simplification)
--rules until you get to a value that cannot be reduced further. Write
--your answer by filling in the following block comment.

{-(S r) returns S (S(S(S

O))). Because evenb evaluates

successive nats as evenb of the

final nat, evenb (S r) = evenb O = true

-}

-- HOMEWORK #11 Here's a function that takes a pair of natural numbers
-- (values of type nat) and that returns their sum (as another value
-- of type nat). We give you the function name and type along with the
-- left hand sides of the two rules that you'll need. We've filled in
-- the right hand sides with placeholders. Your task is to replace the
-- right hand sides of the two rules.

-- Here are a few examples of how this function should work, to get
-- you going. We use ==> to mean "reduces to" or "returns"

-- addp (mkPair O O) ==> O
-- addp (mkPair O (S (S O))) ==> S (S O)
-- addp (mkPair (S O) O) ==> S O
-- addp (mkPair (S (S O)) (S (S (S O)))) ==> S (S (S (S (S O))))

-- Completing the first rule should be pretty easy. Just think about
-- the most basic properties of arithmetic. The second rule is more
-- challenging. Go back and study the evenb example. Notice how we
-- used evenb within its own definition! The idea is that we can
-- compute evenb for a big number by returning the result that we get
-- when we apply it to a number that is two less than the number that
-- we started with. You're going to use a similar idea here.

-- This is the hardest but also the most important problem in this
  -- problem set. There is *no grading penalty* for not getting an
  -- answer to this problem. There is no grading reward for getting
  -- it. Really: do *not* collaborate on this problem. It will help
  -- us instructors to see how you do.
